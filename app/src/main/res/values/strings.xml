    <string name="mercury_text_box_1">
        The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly
        larger than Earths Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three
        times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as 11
        times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our
        solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
        But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.
        Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.

    <string name="mercury_text_box_2">Size and Distance</string>
    <string name="mercury_text_box_3">
        With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width
        of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.
        From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4
        astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the
        distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel
        from the Sun to Mercury.</string>
    <string name="mercury_text_box_4">Orbit and Rotation</string>
    <string name="mercury_text_box_5">
        Mercurys highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles
        (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun.
        It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles
        (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet. Mercury spins slowly on its axis
        and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its
        elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not
        accompanied by a sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun
        appears to rise briefly, set and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The
        same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar
        day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days—just over two years on Mercury.
        Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit
        around the Sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience
        seasons like many other planets do.
    </string>
    <string name="mercury_text_box_6">Formation</string>
    <string name="mercury_text_box_7">
        Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust
        together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets,
        Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.

    <!-- venus information -->
    <string name="venus">Venus</string>
    <string name="venus_text_box_1">
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor. Similar in
        structure and size to Earth, Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets.
        Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet
        in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the
        clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess
        of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the Ancient Greeks.
    </string>
    <string name="venus_text_box_2">Size and Distance</string>
    <string name="venus_text_box_3">
        With a radius of 3,760 miles (6,052 kilometers), Venus is roughly the same size as Earth —
        just slightly smaller. From an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers)
        , Venus is 0.7 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit
        (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. It takes sunlight 6 minutes to
        travel from the Sun to Venus.
    </string>
    <string name="venus_text_box_4">Orbit and Rotation</string>
    <string name="venus_text_box_5">
        Venus rotation and orbit are unusual in several ways. Venus is one of just two planets that
        rotate from east to west. Only Venus and Uranus have this "backwards" rotation. It completes
        one rotation in 243 Earth days — the longest day of any planet in our solar system, even
        longer than a whole year on Venus. But the Sun doesnt rise and set each "day" on Venus
        like it does on most other planets. On Venus, one day-night cycle takes 117 Earth days
        because Venus rotates in the direction opposite of its orbital revolution around the Sun.
        Venus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Venusian time) in 225 Earth days or
        slightly less than two Venusian day-night cycles. Its orbit around the Sun is the most
        circular of any planet — nearly a perfect circle. Other planet's orbits are more
        elliptical, or oval-shaped. With an axial tilt of just 3 degrees, Venus spins nearly
        upright, and so does not experience noticeable seasons.</string>
    <string name="venus_text_box_6">Formation</string>

        When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Venus
        formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form the second planet from
        the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Venus has a central core, a rocky mantle and

    <!-- earth information -->
    <string name="earth">Earth</string>
    <string name="earth_text_box_1">
        Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far
        that’s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the
        solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.
        Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest
        to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. The name Earth is at least 1,000 years
        old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and
        goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”
    </string>
    <string name="earth_text_box_2">Size and Distance</string>
    <string name="earth_text_box_3">
        With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial
        planets, and the fifth largest planet overall. From an average distance of 93 million miles
        (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because
        one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit
        provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun. It takes about
        eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.
    </string>
    <string name="earth_text_box_4">Orbit and Rotation</string>
    <string name="earth_text_box_5">
        As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days
        to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to
        our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars
        consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is
        called a leap day, and the year its added to is called a leap year. Earths axis of
        rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earths orbit around the Sun.
        This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern
        hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun
        higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less
        direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is
        reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of
        heat from the Sun.

        When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth
        formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the
        Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle and a
        solid crust.

    <!-- mars information -->
    <string name="mars">Mars</string>
    <string name="mars_text_box_1">
        The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin
        atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons
        and weather. Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and its the only
        planet where we have sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots
        of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of
        years ago. Mars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was
        reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute; for
        example, the Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is
        frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or
        rust, causing the surface to look red. A Martian Sunset On May 19th, 2005, NASA's Mars
        Exploration Rover Spirit captured this stunning view as the Sun sank below the rim of
        Gusev crater on Mars. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Texas A and M/Cornell

    <string name="mars_text_box_3">
        With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth.
        If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry. From an
        average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical
        units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from
        the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun
        to Mars.
    </string>
    <string name="mars_text_box_4">Orbit and Rotation</string>
    <string name="mars_text_box_5">
        As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar
        to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols—short for "solar day." A
        year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days. Mars axis of rotation
        is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another
        similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has
        distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer
        to orbit the Sun (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly
        spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary
        in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun. Spring in the
        northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn
        in the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern
        winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols.
